## HISTORY OF JAVASCRIPT
JavaScript was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich, it transformed the web from static pages into dynamic, interactive experiences, sparking a digital revolution. With the groundbreaking ES6 (2015) update, it gained powerful features like arrow functions, classes, and modules, empowering developers to build faster, smarter applications. Today, JavaScript continues to evolve, driving innovation across web, mobile, and backend development, proving that with the right tools, the possibilities are limitless.

## JAVASCRIPT
JavaScript programs the behavior of the web and it's the backbone of modern web development that enables interactive and dynamic experiences across various platforms.

## JAVASCRIPT APPLICATIONS
- **Front-End Development** â€“ JavaScript powers modern frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js, enabling developers to build highly responsive and interactive user interfaces. It enhances the user experience by making web pages dynamic, fast, and visually appealing.
- **Back-End Development (Node.js)** â€“ With Node.js, JavaScript runs on the server, handling APIs, databases, and authentication efficiently. This allows developers to use a single language for both front-end and back-end, streamlining development and improving performance.
- **Full-Stack Development** â€“ JavaScript bridges the gap between client-side and server-side development, enabling seamless data flow between the UI and backend. This makes it the go-to language for full-stack applications, reducing complexity and development time.
- **Mobile App Development (React Native & Ionic)** â€“ JavaScript allows developers to build cross-platform mobile apps that work on both Android and iOS with a single codebase. This reduces development costs and ensures a faster time to market without sacrificing performance.

## FUNDAMENTALS OF JAVASCRIPT
| Concept | Description | Example |
| ----------- | ----------- |----------- |
| Printing Output	 | Used to display messages in the console. | ```js console.log("Hello, World!"); ``` |
| Variables | Used to store data. let (changeable), const (fixed). | ```js let name = "John"; const age = 25; ``` |
| Data Types | JavaScript supports Strings, Numbers, Booleans, Arrays, Objects, etc. | ```js let num = 10; let arr = [1, 2, 3]; let obj = {name: "Alice"}; ``` |
| Operators | Perform arithmetic and logical operations. | ```js let a = 10, b = 5; console.log(a + b); // 15 ``` |
